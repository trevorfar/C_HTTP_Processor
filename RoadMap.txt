1. Custom Middleware and Routing
Implement a custom routing system to handle specific URLs dynamically.
Build middleware to preprocess requests (e.g., authentication, logging, or rate-limiting).
2. Dynamic Content Generation
Create dynamic pages by embedding C logic to serve personalized or real-time content (e.g., fetching data from a file or in-memory structure).
Use templates and C to inject dynamic content into HTML.
3. Database Integration
Implement a lightweight database in C (e.g., use SQLite or write your own key-value store).
Write C code to handle CRUD operations and optimize database access.
4. API Development
Build a RESTful or RPC-style API server in C.
Use C libraries like libcurl or sockets for HTTP/HTTPS communication.
5. File Handling and Caching
Implement a file caching system to improve performance.
Add support for large file uploads/downloads and efficient processing of binary data.
6. WebSocket Support
Add WebSocket functionality for real-time communication, such as chat applications or live data streaming.
7. Concurrency
Use multithreading (via pthreads) or multiprocessing to handle multiple connections efficiently.
Implement your own thread pool or non-blocking I/O system.
8. Security Features
Add HTTPS support with OpenSSL for secure communication.
Implement request validation and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
9. Performance Monitoring
Write utilities in C to log performance metrics, such as response times and memory usage.
Analyze bottlenecks and optimize your server using profiling tools.
10. Embedded Systems Integration
If applicable, extend your server to interface with hardware sensors or devices.
Create a backend in C that communicates with IoT devices.
Tools and Libraries:
Libs to Explore: libuv (event-driven programming), libcurl (HTTP), SQLite (embedded database).
HTTP Parsers: Consider using libraries like http-parser or write your own.
SSL: OpenSSL or mbedTLS for secure communication.
