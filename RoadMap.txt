DONE 1. Custom Middleware and Routing
Implement a custom routing system to handle specific URLs dynamically.
Build middleware to preprocess requests (e.g., authentication, logging, or rate-limiting).

Unnecessary 2. Dynamic Content Generation
Create dynamic pages by embedding C logic to serve personalized or real-time content (e.g., fetching data from a file or in-memory structure).
Use templates and C to inject dynamic content into HTML.

Quite hard 3. Database Integration
Implement a lightweight database in C (e.g., use SQLite or write your own key-value store).
Write C code to handle CRUD operations and optimize database access.

4. API Development
Build a RESTful or RPC-style API server in C.
Use C libraries like libcurl or sockets for HTTP/HTTPS communication.

5. File Handling and Caching
Implement a file caching system to improve performance.
Add support for large file uploads/downloads and efficient processing of binary data.

6. WebSocket Support
Add WebSocket functionality for real-time communication, such as chat applications or live data streaming.

7. Concurrency
Use multithreading (via pthreads) or multiprocessing to handle multiple connections efficiently.
Implement your own thread pool or non-blocking I/O system.

8. Security Features
Add HTTPS support with OpenSSL for secure communication.
Implement request validation and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).

9. Performance Monitoring
Write utilities in C to log performance metrics, such as response times and memory usage.
Analyze bottlenecks and optimize your server using profiling tools.
